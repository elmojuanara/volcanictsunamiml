This project includes models and algorithms for predicting the highest elevation, full waveform, and warning level time based on given data.

Data
The data used in this project consists of time-series data from various locations tide gauges, each represented by a unique identifier. 
The locations and their corresponding identifiers are as follows:

ts_0001: Rakata 1
ts_0002: Sertung 2
ts_0003: Sertung 3
ts_0004: Panjang 4
ts_0005: Panjang 5
ts_0006: Rakata 6
ts_0007: Kota Agung
ts_0008: Panjang
ts_0009: Ciwandan
ts_0010: Marina Jambu

Models and Algorithms
Highest Elevation Prediction
This model predicts the highest elevation based on the input time-series data. The prediction algorithm uses machine learning techniques to analyze patterns and trends in the data.

Full Waveform Prediction
This model predicts the full waveform for a given location and time period in this case only use rakata_6. The algorithm takes into account various factors and uses advanced prediction techniques to provide accurate results.

Warning Level Time
This model predicts the warning level time based on the input data. It helps in determining the time at which a warning should be issued based on the predicted patterns in the data as future risk management.
